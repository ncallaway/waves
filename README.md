# Waves

Waves is (going to be) a simple game where you can only view your current location, and the location of various obstructions, though the interaction of waves.

## Implementation

Waves is planning on using an implementation of Wave Particles to simulate the motion of waves through the application.

*waves_core*: This is the core implementation of the wave and wave-particle simulation. It's implemented in rust.

*waves_unity*: This is where the rendering and UI code happens. This is currently based on Unity, but may have a UE4 implementation replace it eventually.
